# Scotch Gambit Chess Opening Trainer

A Next.js 15 application to help train chess openings, specifically the Scotch Gambit. The app will use an interactive chess board where users practice opening moves against computer responses based on a weighted JSON tree structure.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initial project setup and planning
- [x] Set up Next.js 15 project structure (was already configured)
- [x] Install and configure required dependencies (chess.js, react-chessboard)
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS for modern UI styling (was already configured)
- [x] Create basic project structure and components
- [x] Install and configure chess.js library
- [x] Create chess board component with react-chessboard
- [x] Implement chess game state management
- [x] Add move validation and legal move checking
- [x] Design JSON schema for opening tree with frequency weights
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for opening data structure
- [x] Implement move tree traversal logic
- [x] Add weighted random selection for opponent moves
- [x] Implement move validation against opening tree
- [x] Create feedback system for correct/incorrect moves
- [x] Add progression tracking through opening variations
- [x] Implement reset functionality when reaching tree end
- [x] Design and implement main game interface
- [x] Create move history display
- [x] Implement feedback messaging system
- [x] Add reset/restart controls
- [x] Research and structure Scotch Gambit main line moves
- [x] Add common variations and sidelines
- [x] Include frequency data for opponent responses

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Configure TypeScript and ESLint for chess-specific types (partially done, some linting errors remain)

## Recently Completed

- [x] Test the full application functionality - ✅ **APP IS WORKING!**
- [x] Improve chess board sizing for desktop (larger board: 500px → 600px)
- [x] Remove training progress component for cleaner UI
- [x] Fix text visibility with better spacing and padding

## Future Tasks

### User Interface Enhancements
- [ ] Add current position indicator in opening tree
- [ ] Create responsive design for mobile devices

### Opening Data
- [ ] Validate opening tree completeness
- [ ] Add more Scotch Gambit variations and sidelines

### Polish and Optimization
- [ ] Add smooth animations for piece movement
- [ ] Implement sound effects for moves and feedback
- [ ] Optimize performance for large opening trees
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Create responsive design for mobile devices

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview
The application will follow a component-based architecture with:
- **Game State Management**: React hooks for chess position and opening progress
- **Opening Tree**: JSON-based tree structure with weighted opponent responses
- **Move Validation**: Integration between chess.js and opening tree
- **UI Components**: Modular chess board, controls, and feedback systems

### Data Flow
1. User makes a move on the chess board
2. Move is validated against current opening tree position
3. If valid: opponent responds with weighted random selection from children
4. If invalid: negative feedback is shown, user must try again
5. Game continues until reaching end of variation or user resets

### Core Components Needed
- `ChessBoard`: Interactive chess board with piece movement
- `OpeningTree`: Tree traversal and move validation logic
- `GameState`: Chess position and opening progress management
- `FeedbackSystem`: User feedback for correct/incorrect moves
- `MoveHistory`: Display of moves played in current variation
- `Controls`: Reset, hint, and navigation controls

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Chess Logic**: chess.js for game rules and validation
- **Chess UI**: react-chessboard for visual board representation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for chess positions and opening data

### Data Structure Example
```typescript
interface OpeningNode {
  move: string | null; // SAN notation or null for root
  comment?: string; // Optional annotation
  children: Record<string, OpeningNode>;
  frequency?: number; // 0-1 weight for opponent move selection
  isEndOfVariation?: boolean;
}
```

### Environment Configuration
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint with chess-specific rules
- Development server with hot reload

## Development Notes

### Scotch Gambit Opening
The Scotch Gambit starts with:
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4 exd4
4. Bc4 (the gambit move)

The training will focus on White's responses to Black's various defenses after the gambit is offered.

### Move Frequency System
Black's responses will be weighted by frequency:
- `frequency: 0.8` - Very common moves (80% selection chance)
- `frequency: 0.5` - Moderately common moves (50% selection chance)
- `frequency: 0.2` - Rare but important moves (20% selection chance)

### User Experience Goals
- Immediate visual feedback for correct/incorrect moves
- Smooth piece animations and responsive design
- Clear indication of current position in opening tree
- Easy reset and restart functionality
- Progressive difficulty as user learns the opening
